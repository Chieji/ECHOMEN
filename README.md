**ECHO** is an Elite AI Workstation designed for **Action over Conversation.** It transforms your machine into a self-orchestrating multi-agent powerhouse, fusing a high-fidelity execution engine with a persistent "Second Brain."

## 🧠 The Second Brain (Knowledge & Memory)
ECHO doesn't just execute; it *remembers* and *connects*.
-   **[[Wiki-Linking]]:** Use standard wiki syntax to link notes, artifacts, and tasks.
-   **Bidirectional Echoes:** Automatic backlink detection in the Intelligence Sidebar.
-   **FlexSearch Recall:** Sub-millisecond global search across all logs and artifacts.
-   **Neural Vault:** Export your entire knowledge base as a portable, structured ZIP archive.

## ⚡ WebHawk 2.0 (Agentic Browser)
ECHO sees the web like a human.
-   **Vision Protocol:** Uses Playwright to navigate, screenshot, and reason visually.
-   **AXTree Navigation:** Reads the browser's Accessibility Tree for 100% reliable element interaction.
-   **Persistent Session:** Maintain logins and state across complex multi-step web tasks.

## 🛡️ The ECHO Fortress (Security)
Built with "Principal Architect" rigor.
-   **The Trio (SOUL/AGENTS/TOOLS):** Modular behavior injection via root-level Markdown files.
-   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Mandatory approval gate for privileged tools (Shell, Write, Delete).
-   **Zero-Config Discovery:** Backend automatically scans and proxies local MCP services.

## 🖥️ Elite Workstation UI
-   **Unified Command Deck:** A high-density dashboard for real-time planning and execution.
-   **ECHO-P (Command Palette):** Trigger global actions instantly with `Ctrl + P` or `Cmd + K`.
-   **EchoBrain Pulse:** Real-time visualization of agent thoughts and system health.

## 🚀 Quick Start (V1 Miracle Build)

### 1. The Engine (Backend)
```bash
cd ECHOMEN/backend
npm install
npm start
```
*Runs on port 3001. Handles Shell, Files, and WebHawk.*

### 2. The Cockpit (Frontend)
```bash
cd ECHOMEN
npm install
npm run dev
```
*Configure your keys in the Master Configuration Panel (Settings).*

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
-   **Orchestration:** Recursive ReAct loop (up to Level 3 depth).
-   **AI Bridge:** Unified abstraction for Gemini, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
-   **Secure Storage:** AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials in session memory.
